# Hello, I'm Est3banio! 👋

As a passionate programmer and technology enthusiast, I see coding as a form of art.  
My greatest passion lies in **Ruby on Rails** – a framework that, for me, represents the perfect blend of elegance and efficiency.  

🚀 Constantly in pursuit of new challenges, I strive to enhance my skills and develop innovative, user-friendly solutions.  
🔍 I love experimenting with **new technologies** and working on side projects that inspire and challenge me.  
🛠️ My goal is to write **clean, maintainable code** that not only works but tells a story and creates real value.  

💡 **Collaboration** and **knowledge sharing** are key to success in this rapidly evolving industry.  
Let's **connect and create something great together!**
